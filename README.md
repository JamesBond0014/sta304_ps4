# Overview

This repo contains code and data for forecasting the US 2020 presidential election. It was created by NAME. The purpose is to create a report that summarises the results of a statistical model that we built. Some data is unable to be shared publicly. We detail how to get that below. The sections of this repo are: inputs, outputs, scripts.

Inputs contain data that are unchanged from their original. We use two datasets: 

- [Survey data - detail how to get the survey data.]
- [ACS data - detail how to get the ACS data.]

Outputs contain data that are modified from the input data, the report and supporting material.

- X, 
- Y

Scripts contain R scripts that take inputs and outputs and produce outputs. These are:

- 01_data_cleaning.R
- 02_data_preparation.R
